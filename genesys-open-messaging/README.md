> **CUSTOM APPLICATION - SMS**

The following settings will enable usage of the custom applications to send individual SMSs and handle SMS Campaigns using [Telnyx Messaging API](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/messaging/messages)

1. In the Integrations menu add a new Client Application for Telnyx SMS application. In the Configuration tab provide Application URL pointing to your web server with a path `/auth?state=smsmenu` (e.g `https://yourweb.server.domain.com/auth?state=smsmenu`). To display just SMS tab use `/auth?states=sms`, for SMS Campaign tab use `/auth?state=smscampaign`

   <img src="client/public/images/sms_client_application.png"/>

2. In the Architect / Data Tables menu create a table in which a list of numbers or alpha sender IDs will be defined to be available for each of the queues. You can put a name like `TELNYX_SMS_FROM` and provide that name as a value for `REACT_APP_SMS_FROM_TABLE` parameter in the client `.env` file. Table should have 3 mandatory columns: `id`, `queue` and `from`

 <img src="client/public/images/gc_data_table.png"/>

3. To run SMS Campaigns you need to create the contact list first. In the Outbound / List Managament menu import the contact list from a comma delimeted file. Provide a name with a prefix like `SMS_` and set that prefix in your client `.env` file in `REACT_APP_SMS_CONTACT_LISTS_PREFIX` variable. Contact list should have the mandatory columns included where SMS delivery status will be written: `TELNYX_STATUS`,`TELNYX_TIME`,`TELNYX_PRICE`,`TELNYX_MESSAGE_ID` and `TELNYX_MESSAGE`. Sample file format is as below:

| Number      | Name | Title | TELNYX_STATUS | TELNYX_TIME | TELNYX_PRICE | TELNYX_MESSAGE_ID | TELNYX_MESSAGE |
| ----------- | ---- | ----- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------------- | -------------- |

> **CUSTOM DATA ACTION**

If you would like to send SMS from a Genesys Cloud Architect or a Scripter tool you can configure Web Services Data Action for Telnyx SMS API [Send Message](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/messaging/send-message) method.

1. Go to Integrations / Actions menu and add a new Web Services Data Action

2. In the Contracts section create a JSON object with 4 required parameteres - `from`, `to`, `messaging_profile_id` and `text`

 <img src="client/public/images/sms_data_action_1.png"/>

3. In the Configuration tab provide URL to Telnyx Send SMS POST method `https://api.telnyx.com/v2/messages` and configure `Authorization` header with your API key `Bearer KEY....`

 <img src="client/public/images/sms_data_action_2.png"/>

4. Add a configured data action to your Architect flow or to a Script

5. You can also send a message based on some Genesys Cloud events. To enable that feature configure the triggers to run Architect Workflow where you can pass the variables available in your trigger's Event Schema like `conversationId`, `participantId`, `mediaType` and more. Here is an example to trigger Send SMS data action when an interaction ended in ACD queue.
