In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how configure everything to run the sample apps.

Just follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a Telnyx Account
2. Create an API KEY and purchase a number
3. Configure Messaging Profile
4. Configure Genesys Cloud
5. Set up environment variables
6. Run the code
7. Implement the app as a docker container

---

## Step 1: Sign Up for a Telnyx Mission Control Portal Account

Head to [telnyx.com/sign-up](https://telnyx.com/sign-up) to sign up for your free Telnyx account.

Once signed up you will have access to Telnyx Portal, where you can set up and manage your API KEY, purchase number(s) enabled for messaging.

## Step 2: Create an API KEY

Go to [API Keys](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/api-keys) section and click on `Create API Key` button. It will generate a key for you. Copy and save this key in a safe place and don't share it with anyone it is a sensitive value.

## Step 3: Configure Messaging Profile

Go to [Programmable Messaging](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/programmable-messaging/profiles) section and create a new messaging profile.
In the webhook URL field point to your backend server API endpoint.

## Step 4. Configure Genesys Cloud

For all details please refer to the Genesys Cloud Open Messaging integration here - https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/get-started-with-open-messaging

1. Logon to GC organization with admin permissions.
   In the Message / Platform Configs menu create a new platform config

2. In the Message / Platforms menu create a new integration for Open Messaging and select platform config created in the previous step. Note the secret token provided there as you will need to set it in the server `.env` file.

3. In the Integrations / OAuth menu create a new Code Authorization grant type client and set the required scope - `architect`, `conversations`, `groups`, `notifications`, `outbound`, `response-management`, `routing` and `users`. Note the created `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields and set it in the server `.env` file.

4. In the Integrations / OAuth menu create a new Client Credentials grant type client. Note the created `Client ID` and `Client Secret` and set it in the server `.env` file.

5. In the Integrations add a new Client Application for Telnyx SMS web application. In the Configuration tab provide Application URL pointing to your web server with a path `/auth?state=smsmenu` (e.g `https://yourweb.server.domain.com/auth?state=smsmenu`). To display just SMS tab use `/auth?states=sms`, for SMS Campaign tab use `/auth?state=smscampaign`

   ![](client/public/images/sms_client_application.png)

6. Repeat point 5 for Number Lookup application but use a different path `/auth?state=nlmenu`. To display just Number Lookup tab use `/auth?states=nl`, for NL Campaign tab use `/auth?state=nlcampaign`

7. In the Integrations menu create a new widget application to be available when handling voice calls. In the Configuration tab provide URL to your web server with the path `/auth?state=sms` (e.g. `https://your_web_server/auth?state=sms`)

   ![](client/public/images/sms_widget_application.png)

In the Advanced tab provide the following JSON object:

```js
{
  "lifecycle": {
    "ephemeral": false,
    "hooks": {
      "focus": false,
      "blur": false,
      "bootstrap": false,
      "stop": false
    }
  },
  "icon": {
    "vector": "https://your_web_server/images/telnyx-color.svg"
  },
  "monochromicIcon": {
    "vector": "https://your_web_server/images/telnyx-color.svg"
  }
}
```

8. In Genesys Cloud Architect create a new Inbound Message Flow to route incoming SMSs to your queue

9. If you would like to send SMS from Genesys Cloud Architect or Scripter tool you can configure Web Services Data Action for Telnyx SMS API Send Message method as documented here - https://developers.telnyx.com/api/messaging/send-message

In the Contracts section create a JSON object with 4 required parameteres - `from`, `to`, `messaging_profile_id` and `text`

![](client/public/images/sms_data_action_1.png)

In the Configuration tab provide URL to Telnyx Send SMS POST method `https://api.telnyx.com/v2/messages` and configure `Authorization` header with your API key `Bearer KEY....`

## Step 5. Set up environment variables

Create a new copy of `.env.sample` with the name `.env` and set the variables listed in the files both in server and client folders:

Your `.env` files should look like this:

#### SERVER FOLDER

```js
# Environment

```

## Step 6: Run the code

After you have cloned this repo:

```bash
  % git clone https://github.com/team-telnyx/genesys-open-messaging.git
```

Run the commands

1 - `yarn install` to install the dependencies in a server folder

2 - `yarn start` will initialize the backend server.

## Step 7: Implement the app as a docker container

If you would like to deploy the app to your Docker infrastructure you can run `docker compose up --build -d` from a main folder.
